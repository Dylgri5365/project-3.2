          <p>This project provides a window into a complex history of new development and change in 20th century art. The project opens the treasures of the CAVS Special Collection to the public eye by documenting digitized works in a database that is uniquely browsable, searchable, and freely accessible. The CAVS Digital Special Collection offers international, creative and scholarly audiences of artists and academics a hands-on approach to understanding 20th century experiments in art, collaboration between artists and scientists, and emerging technologies.</p>
